in bios if you dont have option for intel-vt to enable virtualization in cpu. lets used some trick?

first go to device security> core isolation > change memory integirity to off

then go to add and remove feature in program > make hyper-v on > restart> then  hyper-v off > restart

check again in leo-moon cpu-v> it should be virtualization support ok  - vt-x enabled is on . thats all.
